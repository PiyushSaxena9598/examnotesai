🚀 Project Showcase: Exam Notes AI Generator
I’m excited to share a project I’ve been working on — Exam Notes AI Generator, an AI-powered web application built using the MERN stack and Google Gemini API to help students generate structured, exam-ready notes in seconds.
📚 What problem does it solve?
 Students often spend more time creating notes than studying them. This platform automates note generation, allowing learners to focus on understanding concepts rather than formatting content.
🛠️ Tech Stack Used
1. MongoDB – Stores users, history, and generated notes
2. Express.js – Backend REST APIs
3. React.js – Modern, responsive UI
4. Node.js – Server-side logic
5. Google Gemini API – AI-powered content generation

✨ Key Features
1. 🔐 Secure authentication (login, signup, forgot password)
2. 🤖 AI-generated exam-oriented notes from user topics
3. 📄 Structured output with headings, bullet points, and clarity
4. 🕒 Notes history tracking for revision
5. 📥 PDF export/download functionality
6. 💳 Credit-based system to manage AI usage
7. 📱 Fully responsive design for mobile & desktop

⚙️ How it works
1. User enters a topic or syllabus
2. The backend sends the prompt to the Gemini API
3. AI generates concise, exam-focused notes
4. Notes are displayed, saved, and can be downloaded as PDF

🧠 What I learned
